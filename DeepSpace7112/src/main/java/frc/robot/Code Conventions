- The first word of variable names must start with a lower case letter,
 and every additional word there must start with a capital letter.

- Variable names of variables with fixed values (constants) must start with a lower case k 
 (therfore the first word of the actual name will start with a capital letter, after the k.).

- Variables that are Constants should be suppliers and should be initialized using ConstantHandler.

- All words in a class name must start with a capital letter.

- RobotMap should have no nested classes or interfaces, but should be divided to blocks for each subsystem,
 each titled with a comment of the subsystem name sorrunded by ten hyphens ("//----------Elevator----------",
 for example). The blocks should be indented such that they can be collapsed to their titles.

- SubsystemComponents must be divided into static interfaces for each subsystem.
